## Description
This repository contains the implementation of the MAYO signature scheme in the Rust programming language. The implementation was part of our Master's thesis project with the goal of exploring efficient implementations of the scheme, particularly focused on optimizations targeting the ARMv8 architecture using NEON intrinsics. Parts of the code is inspired by the MAYO authors implementation found at: https://github.com/PQCMayo/MAYO-C. Furthermore, their specification can be found at: https://pqmayo.org/.
